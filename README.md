# VU

This repository contains things needed for the Research project. Especially scripts in Julia and some TEX files with theory. As the time goes by I will add more and more things. 
## Tasks
> - [ ] 1. The problem of discriminative models for set data i.e. one element is composed of a vector. Show sensitivity of this approach to the lack of validation data.
>> Suppose we have two classes 0 and 1 thus data are labeled either as 0 or 1. What happens, if we have many more elements from, for example, class '1'?
